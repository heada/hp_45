This project is a development of a control system for a HP 45 thermal inkjet cartridge. 
The intention was to create an oppertunity make it possible to use "easy to get" cartridges like the HP 45 in CNC projects. 
Hardware: 
The sourcecode is compatible to Arduino Mega 2560 and Ardino Due boards respectively AVR 2560 8-bit and SAM3X8E 32-bit microcontroller.
The needed shield and cardridge connection will be added later on.

Software:
The software part can be uploaded with the Arduino IDE trough "hp45_upload_code.ino"
